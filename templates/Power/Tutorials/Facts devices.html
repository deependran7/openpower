                     <div class="article">
                          Electricity has now been Interconnected power system has been an inherent part of the
                        todayâ€™s electrical generation. It has becoming more and more complex as there are
                        multiple ways of generations, transmission and distribution, so there is great challenge
                        for proper flow of power and ensuring the system stability. Despite the various use of
                        classical controllers (mechanical switching devices), the implementation of high
                        performance devices is encouraged.
                        The modern system that has the ability of varying the power flow parameters like voltage,
                        impedance, admittance, power angle, damping oscillation etc. in order to enhance the
                        power flow capability is FACTS (Flexible Alternating Current Transmission).
                        Among various FACTS devices, SVC is one of the most popular, reliable and economic
                        controller used in modern power system. It is acquired to have very good design and
                        performance analysis of the SVC device for its better working in the power network.
                        Static Var Compensators are being increasingly applied in electric transmission systems
                        to economically improve voltage control and post-disturbance recovery voltages that can
                        lead to system instability. An SVC provides such system improvements and benefits by
                        controlling shunt reactive power sources, both capacitive and inductive, with power
                        electronic switching devices.
